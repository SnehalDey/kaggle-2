I have used Light Gradient Boost for training my Model.
I have used various other training models like random forest, linear regression, catboost but i found Light gradient boost give
the best prediction. I have used target encoding in coverting the categorical value.
I have increased the number of columns as it increases the performance of the algorithm. 
The code is documented hence there would be no difficulty to understand it.
